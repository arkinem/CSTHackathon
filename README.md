## Few words from us :mega:

Our idea was to give you scenarios from wide range of software development career paths.  
Feel free to interpret them openly, the goal is to create something cool and scenarios are more of the guideline.

If you feel that you don't know how to start or you struggle with something for too long feel free to give us a call, we will try to break it through together.

**_Have Fun!_**:smile:

## Scenario 1

#### Target: File Share App :inbox_tray:

#### Level: Medium

Create file share service, for example, in-between students, managed via UI, all kinds of platforms are welcome. Think of it like an app that you would like to use with your friends during working on student projects, a shared file repository, that authenticated users can view or upload to. You can send files through HTTP or any other protocol.

Improvements suggestions:

- make your solution secure
- implement public/private files mechanism
- add social functionality (eg. local chat, comments)
- handle large files with async upload

## Scenario 2

#### Target: Coronavirus visualisation :chart_with_upwards_trend:

#### Level: Hard

The world is grappling with 2019-nCoV, the new Coronavirus spreading rapidly from the epicentre of the outbreak in Wuhan, the capital of Chinaâ€™s Hubei Province. That virus spreads via human-to-human transmission, it is essential to understand transmission patterns and rates to establish emergency response plans. Your goal is to create a data visualisation, which shows the spread of the disease worldwide, the infection speed or overview over cases. It can be achieved via a web page as well as desktop apps, absolutely free technique, as long as your solution is data-driven.

## Scenario 3

#### Target: Biometric Recognition :detective:

#### Level: Medium-Hard

The idea of this scenario is to use Biometric Recognition for basically what name says, identifying people. There are plenty of implementations of this idea from the doorbell camera able to recognise your roommates to a school security system. Use either machine learning models, or for someone less experienced there are plenty easy to implement python libraries. We want you to create something using this technology, what you can use it for?

_You probably have heard about face recognition, the most famous one, but have you heard about ear recognition, huh?

## Scenario 4

#### Target: Game :video_game:

#### Level: Easy-Medium

Hackathon is always a good place for creating a game with a bunch of friends, that is why we would include it as well. The topic of the game is open, your own version of Flappy Brid is a good area to pick for starters, for someone more experienced we would recommend to consider a game that can at the same time learn you to code - Codewars challenges are a good example.

We would like you to think about the game that other Hackers could play during event, try making competition spirit stronger during Hack! :D

## Scenario 5

#### Target: Personal Page :desktop_computer:

#### Level: Easy

A good way to start programming challenge, as well as practice your web development skills is to create your own portfolio/blog page. This kind of content is a good opportunity to present your practical skills in a simple and elegant way to your potential future employer. A website can be used as your digital CV. Try to express yourself and include your digital portfolio (or a faked one if you don't have/don't want to use your work).
As an extension, you can implement a CMS to easily edit content in the future.

## Scenario 6

#### Target: Real-time monitoring system :stopwatch:

#### Level: Easy-Medium-Hard

Ability to create real-time monitoring systems is desired in almost every industry. Well optimized, fast and performant systems can bring fortune to the company. This task is open to any system that collects data from some sort of emitter and displays it to the user in a meaningful way.

Examples:

**_Easy_**  
A desktop application that logs all websites visited by current PC user and displays diagrams/tabular data.

**_Medium_**  
A mobile app that uses one of the device sensors (GPS, accelerometer, barometer, gyroscope, magnetometer, pedometer etc.) and transmits it to a database. Within the same, or with another mobile/web application display data to end-user. The simple fitness app is an example of this difficulty level.

**_Hard_**  
Same as easy and medium, but this time system implements communication between an external device (smartwatches, Arduino etc) which involves using some 3rd-party SDK.

## Scenario 8

## Scenario 9

#### Target: Game Map Generator & Visualisation :world_map:

#### Level: Easy-Medium

Maybe do you play D&D? What about map generator based on some configuration file? The idea of this scenario is to create game map generator that can be based on an algorithm or on a random seed :smile: It would be cool to somehow visualise generated map 2D, 3D, 4D? We rather make you think about this scenario as about logical challenge.

_Maybe something with fractals, genetic algorithm?_
