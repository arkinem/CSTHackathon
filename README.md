# CSTHackathon
CST Hackathon | University of Bedfordshire
22 - 23 February 2020

## Few words from us.
Our idea was to give you scenarios from width range of dev areas.\
Feel free to interpret them openly, the idea is to create something cool\
and scenarios are more of the guidline.\
If you feel that you struggle on something for to long feel free to give us a call,\
we will try to break it through together.
*Have Fun! :D*

## Scenarios

## Scenario 1
#### Target: File Share App
#### Level: Medium
Create file share service, for example in between of students, managed via UI, all kinds of platforms are welcome.\
Think of it like an app that you would like to use with your friends durring working on student projects,\
relatively small files, simple access. You can send files through http or any other protocol. Thinks to think about:\
how can you make it secure, will there be private files, maybe You want to search for and share gifs through it.\
_Additional improvements? Think about  Social app connection, Async Upload_

## Scenario 2
#### Target: UI, simple Backend
#### Level: Medium
TODO by Blazej

---
## Scenario 3
#### Target: Biometric Recognition
#### Level: Medium-Hard
The idea of this scenario is to use Biometric Recognition for basicaly what name says, identifying people.\
There is plenty implementations of this idea from the doorbell camera able to recognise your roomates to school security system.\
Use either machine learning models, or for someone less experienced there are plenty easy to implement libraries (python?).\
We want You to create something using this technology, what You can use it for?\
_You probably have heard about face recognition, the most famous one, but fave You heard about ear recognition, huh? \

## Scenario 4
#### Target: Game
#### Level: Medium
Hackathon is always the good place for creating game with bunch of friends, that is why we would include it as well.\
We would like you to maybe think about game that other Hackers could play durring event to ...TODO...

## Scenario 5
#### Target: Backend, UI
#### Level: Medium
Create blog page ... TODO

---
## Scenario 6
#### Target: UI, simple Backend
#### Level: Hard
TODO by Blazej

---
## Scenario 7
#### Target: UI
#### Level: Easy
TODO by Blazej or Me

---
## Scenario 8
#### Target: UI
#### Level: Medium
TODO by Blazej

---
## Scenario 9
#### Target: Game Map Generator & Visualisation
#### Level: Easy-Medium
Do you maybe play D&D? What about map generator based on some configuration file?\
The idea of this scenario is to create game map generator that can be based on an algorithm or on an random seed :D\
It would be cool to somehow visualise generated map 2D, 3D, 4D? We rather make you think
about this scenario as about logical challenge.\
_Maybe you can create something with fractals, genetic algorithm_
