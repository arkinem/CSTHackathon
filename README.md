# CSTHackathon
CST Hackathon | University of Bedfordshire
22 - 23 February 2020

## Few words from us.
Our idea was to give you scenarios from width range of dev areas.\
Feel free to interpret them openly, the idea is to create something cool\
and scenarios are more of the guidline.\
If you feel that you struggle on something for to long feel free to give us a call,\
we will try to break it through together.
*Have Fun! :D*

## Scenario 1
#### Target: File Share App
#### Level: Medium
Create file share service, for example in between of students, managed via UI, all kinds of platforms are welcome. Think of it like 
an app that you would like to use with your friends durring working on student projects, relatively small files, simple access. 
You can send files through http or any other protocol. Thinks to consider: how can you make it secure, will there be private files 
maybe you want to search for and share gifs through it. _Additional improvements? Think about social app connection, async upload_

## Scenario 2
#### Target: XXX
#### Level: XXX
TODO by someone

---
## Scenario 3
#### Target: Biometric Recognition
#### Level: Medium-Hard
The idea of this scenario is to use Biometric Recognition for basicaly what name says, identifying people. 
There is plenty implementations of this idea from the doorbell camera able to recognise your roomates to school security system. 
Use either machine learning models, or for someone less experienced there are plenty easy to implement libraries (python?). 
We want you to create something using this technology, what you can use it for? 
_You probably have heard about face recognition, the most famous one, but fave you heard about ear recognition, huh? \

## Scenario 4
#### Target: Game
#### Level: Easy-Medium
Hackathon is always the good place for creating game with bunch of friends, that is why we would include it as well. 
Topic of game is open, your own version of Flappy Brid is a good area to pick for starters, for someone more experienced we would recommend 
thinking about the game that can at the same time learn you to code - Codewars challenges are a good example, consider implementing them 
in your game. We would like you to think about game that other Hackers could play durring event, try making competition spirit stronger durring Hack! :D

## Scenario 5
#### Target: Home Page
#### Level: Easy
Good way to start programming challenge, as well as practice your web dev skills, is to create your own home/blog page. 
This kind of content is a good opportunity to present your practical skills in a simple and elegant way to your potential feature employee. 
There is a various number of options you can pick from when looking for idea for topic of your page. It can be more tech related 
_(it would be nice to include then some way of formatting code on site for specific language)_, or maybe you want to create online art gallery 
_(consider building your own slide show on page)_, every idea is welcome! Consider storying content in either database or external files so you 
can edit it on demand without digging into code.

## Scenario 6
#### Target: E2ee Chat
#### Level: Hard
I'd say is fair to assume that our privacy is the most important thing that we got, even tho not so many of us realize how dangerous the internet can be. More and more often you can see people intercepting the wireless traffic in populated areas such as airports, coffee shops or bars with the aid of small computers such as raspberry pi's. Most of the times the channel that you use to communicate with your beloved ones, share pictures and videos are not that secure as you would probably think.
Your task is to design a safe way of communication where parties can interact per to per or in groups in real-time and also be implementing end-to-end encryption.
Besides that, they also have to be able to share pictures, videos or any other files.

## Scenario 7
#### Target: Trade platform
#### Level: Easy
A lot of people throw their belongings on the road when most of the times those items didn't suffer any damage and they could still be used by somebody else in need.
Your task is to design an app where those items can be listed and picked up by the ones in need free of charge instead of being thrown at the edge of the road. The app should support user registration, login, the items should be listed in categories and the system should provide a search field with filters for location and item category.

## Scenario 8
#### Target: Fake articles
#### Level: Medium
Fake news websites gained so much popularity lately that is challenging to tell which articles are fake or not. The young ones don't fall that easily into that pit, but the older ones often take the bite and believe all they find over the internet.
Your task is to design a neuronal network which can determine whether an article is fraudulent or not by the passing the link of the article as input.
SUGGESTION: Try to look up the name of the article on google and grab the first page of results.

## Scenario 9
#### Target: Game Map Generator & Visualisation
#### Level: Easy-Medium
Do you maybe play D&D? What about map generator based on some configuration file? The idea of this scenario is to create game map generator 
that can be based on an algorithm or on an random seed :D It would be cool to somehow visualise generated map 2D, 3D, 4D? We rather make you 
think about this scenario as about logical challenge. _Maybe you can create something with fractals, genetic algorithm_
